# Malaria Detection System

## Overview
This project is aimed at developing a Malaria Detection System using deep learning techniques. The system processes input images of blood smears and predicts whether the sample is infected with malaria or not.

## Features
- Deep learning model trained on a large dataset of blood smear images.
- Application interface for uploading and processing images.
- Real-time prediction and classification of malaria-infected cells.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask

## Dataset
The dataset used for training consists of labeled images from Kaggle's Malaria Bounding Boxes dataset, containing a total of 1000 images.
